This plugin enables you to display the content of a custom post type called Content Block in a sidebar widget.

== Description ==

The Custom Post Widget allows you to display the contents of a specific custom post in a widget.

Even though you could use the text widget that comes with the default WordPress install, this plugin has some major benefits:

* If you are using the standard WordPress text widgets to display content on various areas of your template, this content can only be edited by users with administrator access. If you would like editors to modify the widget content, you can use this plugin to provide them access to the custom posts that provide the content for the widget areas.
* The Custom Post Widget plugin enables users to use the WYSIWYG editor for editing the content and adding images.
* You can even use the featured image functionality to display them in a widget.
* The Custom Post Widget is compatible with the WPML Multi-Language plugin and automatically shows the correct language in the widget area.
* The Content Blocks can be included in posts and pages using the built-in shortcode functionality.

This plugin creates a 'content_block' custom post type. You can choose to either display the title on the page or use it to describe the contents and widget position of the content block. Note that these content blocks can only be displayed in the context of the page. I have added 'public' => false to the custom post type which means that it is not accessible outside the page context.

To add content to a widget, drag it to the required position in the sidebar and select the title of the custom post in the widget configuration.

This plugin is ready for localization and Dutch, French, German, Polish and Russian language files are included.

You can find more information about this plugin and a screencast video which shows the plugin in action on the [plugin homepage](http://www.vanderwijk.com/wordpress/wordpress-custom-post-widget/).

== Screenshots ==

1. After activating the plugin a new post type called 'Content Blocks' is added. You will also see a button above the WYSIWYG editor that allows you to insert the content block using the shortcode.
2. The widget has a select box to choose the content block. Click on the 'Edit Content Block' link to edit the selected Content Block custom post.

== Installation ==

1. First you will have to upload the plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` folder.
2. Then activate the plugin in the plugin panel.
You will see that a new custom post type has been added called Content Block.
3. Type some content for the widget. You can choose to either use the title to describe the of the content on the page, or to display it. Check 'Show Post Title' to display the title on the page.
4. Go to 'Appearance' > 'Widgets' and drag the Content Block widget to the required position in the sidebar.
5. Select a Content Block from the drop-down list.
6. Check the 'Show Post Title' checkbox if you would like to display the title of your Content Block
7. If you are experiencing issues with content being added automatically to your posts (Social media sharing buttons for instance), check the 'Do not apply content filters' checkbox. Use this with caution!
8. Click save.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I use the default text-widget? =

Of course you can always use the default text widget, but if you prefer to use the WYSIWYG editor or if you have multiple editors and you don't want to give them administrator rights, it is recommended to use this plugin.

= How can I show the content bock on a specific page? =

It is recommended to install the Widget Logic plugin, this will give you complete flexibility on widget placement.

= How can I display the featured image in the widget? =

This plugin has built-in support for the featured image functionality on the edit screen. But to display the image you will have to add the following code to your functions.php:
Note that featured image will not be resized, so you will have to make sure it is the right size when uploading or restrict the image size via the stylesheet.

= My social sharing plugin adds buttons to all the Custom Post Widget areas =

If your social media sharing plugin adds buttons to the widget areas you could check the 'Do not apply content filters' checkbox. Note that when this is done, WordPress will also stop adding paragraph tags to your text, so use this setting with caution. It is much better to ask the developer of the social media sharing buttons plugin to correctly use the content filters (see http://pippinsplugins.com/playing-nice-with-the-content-filter/).

= The title and featured image are not displayed when using the shortcode =

Currently the shortcode function only outputs the post content of the content block, future support for displaying the title and/or the attached featured image is being considered.

= The plugin is not working for me =

Please create a support topic in the forum: http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/custom-post-widget
DO NOT click the 'Broken' button in the compatibility area of the plugin directory before creating a support ticket. It is highly demotivating for me to see the plugin downloads drop dramatically without being given the chance to help you!

= I love your plugin! What can I do to help? =

Creating and supporting this plugin takes up a lot of my free time, therefore I would highly appreciate it if you could take a couple of minutes to [write a review](http://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/custom-post-widget). This will help other WordPress users to start using this plugin and keep me motivated to maintain and support it.

== Upgrade Notice ==

The language files for DE, FR, PL and RU are missing some translation strings because of new functionality that has been added tot the plugin. Any help in updating the translations is highly appreciated!
